> _[ðŸŽ© Bernard]_ Look. They literally are starving out there. You haven't raised the minimum wage at the North Pole since 2009 and they're beginning to realize that if you take inflation into account they're making half of what they did then. Then if you consider how much housing has gone up over the same time it all adds up to a..\

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
How can we change the signature to <code>survivalRatio</code> to make TypeScript give us type errors on the invocations that pass things other than numbers?

## Expected Behavior

```ts
export const reportForSanta = {
	2009: survivalRatio(2009),
	2010: survivalRatio(2010),
	2011: survivalRatio(2011),
	2012: survivalRatio(2012),
	2013: survivalRatio(2013),
	2014: survivalRatio(2014),
	2015: survivalRatio(2015),
	2016: survivalRatio(2016),
	2017: survivalRatio(2017),
	2018: survivalRatio(2018),
	2019: survivalRatio(2019),
	2020: survivalRatio(2020),
	2021: survivalRatio(2021),
	2022: survivalRatio(2022),
	2023: survivalRatio(2023),
}

// @ts-expect-error
survivalRatio('1')

// @ts-expect-error
survivalRatio(true)

// @ts-expect-error
survivalRatio([1])

// @ts-expect-error
survivalRatio({ 1: 1 })
