We need a type for a function that represents the performance review cycle. With this function in hand, perhaps ðŸŽ© Bernard will be able to convince ðŸŽ… Santa to take the reindeer's demands more seriously.

## Expected Behavior

```ts
async function* numberAsyncGenerator() {
	yield 1
	yield 2
	yield 3
}

type Test01 = PerfReview<ReturnType<typeof numberAsyncGenerator>> // => 1 | 2 | 3

async function* stringAsyncGenerator() {
	yield '1%'
	yield '2%'
}

type Test02 = PerfReview<ReturnType<typeof stringAsyncGenerator>> // => '1%' | '2%'
```
