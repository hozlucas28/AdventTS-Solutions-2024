## Expected Behavior

```ts
const { MOOD_LIGHTS } = process.env

type Actual01 = typeof MOOD_LIGHTS // => 'true'

const { BATH_TEMPERATURE } = process.env

type Actual02 = typeof BATH_TEMPERATURE // => '327.59'

const { STRAWBERRIES } = process.env

type Actual03 = typeof STRAWBERRIES // => 'chocolate'
```
