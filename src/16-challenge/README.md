# Challenge 16

> \
> _[ðŸ’‹ Crystal]_ Dear, stop reading the Node.JS release notes. The TC-39 is gonna keep pipeline operators at stage 2 for the next 100 years at this point. Come. Have some some dinner. I've made curry.\

Well that took a dark turn. You're an accessory to the crime, now. Congrats. Now you have no choice but to help ðŸ’‹ Crystal with the coverup.

The `originalCurry` had to have some special ingredients added to it, but ðŸ’‹ Crystal couldn't be sure if ðŸŽ… Santa would see her cooking. So, to avoid raising suspicion, she had to find a way to be able to add the ingredients at different times.

<summary>Hint</summary>
This is a process called "currying". Also known as "partial application". To accomplish this challenge, it's first good to get familiar with how to separate function arguments in TypeScript. Check out the <code>Parameters</code> builtin utility type to see how you might get started.

## Expected Behavior

```ts
const originalCurry = (
	ingredient1: number,
	ingredient2: string,
	ingredient3: boolean,
	ingredient4: Date
) => true

const spikedCurry = DynamicParamsCurrying(originalCurry)

// Direct call
spikedCurry(0, 'Ziltoid', true, new Date())

// Partially applied
spikedCurry(1)('The', false, new Date())

// Another partial
spikedCurry(0, 'Omniscient', true)(new Date())

// You can keep calling until the cows come home: it'll wait for the last argument
spikedCurry()()()()(0, 'Captain', true)()()()(new Date())

// currying is ok
spikedCurry(0, 'Spectacular', true)

// @ts-expect-error arguments provided in the wrong order
spikedCurry('Nebulo9', 0, true)(new Date())
```
