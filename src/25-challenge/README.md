# Challenge 25

### 🎉 That Concludes This Year's Story!

Thank you for participating in our second Advent of TypeScript event! We’re stoked to have had you join us in this event of coding, learning, and community. Your enthusiasm and contributions make events like this truly special, and we hope you enjoyed the challenges as much as we enjoyed putting them together.

This year, you protected Mrs. Claus from her affair being discovered and you were an accessory to inception... but it was for a good cause! The reindeer are now paid fairly! Hopefully 🎅 Santa doesn't ever realize that he's been the victim of a mind control potion. I wonder what else 💋 Crystal changed while she was kickin' around in 🎅 Santa's mind?

Things are gonna get pretty nasty if 🎅 Santa ever realizes what happened. Come back next year to find out!

### Thanks To The Team
