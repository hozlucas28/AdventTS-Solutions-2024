# Challenge 01

### Welcome To Advent of TypeScript 2024!

#### The Stories

What you just read above is part of the story for this year's challenge. This year picks up from last year's story. If it interests you, you can quickly read all of last year's stories on [the AoT 2023 site](https://www.adventofts.com/events/2023). In these stories, we get to know Santa in a much more... personal way than what you might be used to from picture books and cartoons.

The story will often give you a lot of context about the changes you need to make to the TypeScript code. In today's example, we see that we're supposed to modify `Demand` (the TypeScript type) to be a `number`.

#### The Tests

Truth be told, though, you don't really need to read the stories. If you like, you can jump right in to reading the tests to see what the behavior of your type is supposed to be. We'll usually start you off with something, but it'll always be incomplete in some way. Take a look at the tests and make a change to make the tests pass.

#### The Hints

If you need a hint, sometimes you'll see something like this:

<details>
    <summary>Expand me to reveal a hint!</summary>
    <h4><i>[Example]</i></h4>
    <div>Try doing XYZ to ABC and see if the tests pass!</div>
</details>

## Expected Behavior

```ts
type introduction = Demand: // number
```
