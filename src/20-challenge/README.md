# Challenge 20

After discovering the elves' code automation scheme, ðŸŽ© Bernard was... impressed! But now he's sending it back along with every lazy elf's worst nightmare: more work...

> _[ðŸŽ© Bernard]_ This is a good start, but we need to track which variables are actually being used. We can't have unused variables cluttering up our toy production scripts - who knows what kind of bugs that could cause!

The elves need to enhance their code analyzer to track both declared variables AND their usage. For each script, they need to report:

- All variables that are declared (using `let`, `const`, or `var`)
- All variables that are actually used (as function arguments)

For example, when analyzing:

```ts
let robotDog = 'deluxe_model'
assembleToy(robotDog)
```

The analyzer should produce:

```ts
{
  declared: ["robotDog"],
  used: ["robotDog"]
}
```

And if variables are declared but never used (like in `let teddyBear = "standard_model";`), they should only appear in the `declared` array, not the `used` array.

Implement a type `AnalyzeScope` that performs this analysis, handling:

- Variable declarations with any amount of whitespace
- Function calls with variable references
- Multiple declarations and usages in the same script
- Empty or whitespace-only scripts

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Consider breaking down the analysis into two parts: one for gathering declarations and another for finding usages. Remember that variables can be declared without being used, and whitespace can appear anywhere!

## Expected Behavior

```ts
type Test01 = AnalyzeScope<`
let teddyBear = "standard_model";
`>
/**
 * => {
 *      declared: ['teddyBear']
 *      used: []
 *    }
 */

type Test02 = AnalyzeScope<`
buildToy(teddyBear);
`>
/**
 * => {
 *      declared: []
 *      used: ['teddyBear']
 *    }
 */

type Test03 = AnalyzeScope<`
let robotDog = "deluxe_model";
assembleToy(robotDog);
`>
/**
 * => {
 *      declared: ['robotDog']
 *      used: ['robotDog']
 *    }
 */

type Test04 = AnalyzeScope<`
  let robotDog = "standard_model";
  const giftBox = "premium_wrap";
    var ribbon123 = "silk";

  \t
  wrapGift(giftBox);
  \r\n
      addRibbon(ribbon123);
`>
/**
 * => {
 *      declared: ['robotDog', 'giftBox', 'ribbon123']
 *      used: ['giftBox', 'ribbon123']
 *    }
 */

type Test05 = '\n\t\r \t\r '
/**
 * => {
 *      declared: []
 *      used: []
 *    }
 */
```
