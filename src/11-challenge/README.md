## Expected Behavior

```ts
const existingExcuses = {
	karaoke: ['Kendrick Lamar, Opeth'],
	margarita: 'Peppermint-JalapeÃ±o Mojito',
}

const helpingTheReindeer = {
	helping: 'the reindeer',
} as const

declare const Excuse01: Excuse<typeof helpingTheReindeer>

const excuse01 = new Excuse01({
	...existingExcuses,
	...helpingTheReindeer,
})

type Actual01 = typeof excuse01 // => 'helping: the reindeer'

const eatingFudge = {
	eating: 'fudge',
} as const

declare const Excuse02: Excuse<typeof eatingFudge>

const excuse02 = new Excuse02({
	...existingExcuses,
	...eatingFudge,
})

type Actual02 = typeof excuse02 // => 'eating: fudge'
```
