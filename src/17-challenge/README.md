# Challenge 17

_[ðŸŽ… Santa was the victim of a magical mind-control potion, prepared by his own Mrs. Claus: ðŸ’‹ Crystal Claus. It's the next morning and ðŸŽ… Santa is just walking into the break room where all the reindeer were preparing for the day's chores.]_

_[ðŸŽ… Santa]_ My dear _wonderful_ reindeer! How truly magnificent you all are! I don't do enough to show my appreciation for you!

_[ðŸ”´ Rudolph]_ Um. Are you feeling ok? Also, if the answer is "yes", you better not be about to give us $15 starbucks gift cards again as our "big bonus this season".

_[ðŸŽ… Santa]_ ðŸ”´ Rudolph, ðŸ”´ Rudolph, sweet ðŸ”´ Rudolph. I have had an awakening! It actually is $15 dollars! But it's a $15 dollar per hour salary increase for every reindeer!!

_[Silence. Utter silence in the room. The reindeer are in shock. Several long moments pass. The reindeer are expecting ðŸŽ… Santa to laugh in their faces and say it's all a joke...]_

_[ðŸŽ… Santa]_ draw up some composable contracts! I'll sign them all today!

You heard him! We need to make a general purpose `compose` function. This particular (simplified) function just takes functors, and returns the result of calling each, passing the result of the previous.

<summary>Hint</summary>
Think through the problem step by step, as if you were calling <code>h(g(f(a)))</code> in your own code. Start by individually typing all of the helper functions, then once you feel confident about those, work up from there. Don't forget about the `intrinsic` builtins!

## Expected Behavior

```ts
const Test01 = compose(upperCase, makeTuple, makeBox)('hello!').value[0] // => "HELLO!"
const Test02 = compose(makeTuple, firstItem, makeBox)('hello!' as const).value // => "hello!"
const Test03 = compose(upperCase, firstChar, lowerCase)('hello!') // => "h"
```
